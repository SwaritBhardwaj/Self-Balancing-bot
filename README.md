# Self-Balancing-bot
Self Balancing Bot made using PID control. The chasis is made from acrylic using laser cutting. The sensors include IMU i.e. MPU6050, while the actuator includes two beefy high torque motors.

The DXF file(laser cutting machine readable file) of the chasis parts will be provided in the chasis forlder, along the the stp file(2D design file) which can be viewed using a software like solidworks.
